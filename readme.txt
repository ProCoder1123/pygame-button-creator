INSTRUCTIONS
The class will ask for 11 positional params when called.
These are:
  - game (say "self")
  - msg (your message in double quotes)
  - width, height (obvious)
  - bg_color, text_color (the BG color (make it white if its not a button) and the text color)
  - font (font name (if u aren't sure about names, say None.)
  - size (font size. just specify a number such as 48 or 72)
  - pos (use if you want to use pygame coordinates (e.g. topleft or bottomright).
      - otherwise, say None.
  - x, y (alternative to pos.)
      - if u wanna use pos and not exact coordinates, say 0 to BOTH x and y.

Happy coding :)
